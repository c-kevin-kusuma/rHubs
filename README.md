## Overview

Building an R package to retrieve, analyze, and update objects on HubSpot such as Companies, Contacts, and Deals. This package is designed to pull and push data between R and HubSpot via API calls using generated Access Token. In order to use this package, a valid HubSpot instance and an account with sufficient access are required. All inputs and outputs in this package will be in dataframes. Functions in this package will automatically perform translations between JSON and dataframe to match the required input and output of HubSpot objects.

## Examples with Company Object
Pull Request
```r
# Attach the installed rHubs package by calling the library() function
library(rHubs)

# Pull current company properties
properties <- propertyList(accessToken = accessToken, object_type = "companies")

# Pull current company List - the first batch of 10 companies
current_companies <- companyList(accessToken = accessToken)

# Recursive example to pull all companies
companyListAll <- companyListAll(accessToken = accessToken)

```

Push Request
```r
# Create/Add New Companies and save the creation report
## "name" field which represents the company's name must present in your "data" input
new_company <- createCompanies(accessToken = accessToken, data = data)

# Update company properties and save the update report
## "companyId" field must presents in the data input
update_report <- updateCompanies(accessToken = accessTokeny, data = data) 

# Delete Current Companies and save the deletion report
## This "deleteCompanies()" function performs a DESTRUCTIVE action and is best used only to delete companies that were generated by your application
## "companyId" field must presents in the data input
deleted_companies <- deleteCompanies(accessToken = accessToken, companyId = companyId)
```
